## Demo

## Details for teaching team
* Sign up is by invitation only, at this route: http://p4.beckrecca.me/V5RDN82zU67F8oG88x4q
* My family has already started using this as of 12/14, but don't feel weird about creating events, posting comments, editing, deleting, etc. to make sure I completed the assignment. I'd just ask that you only delete events you create yourself!
* Event is already a built-in model in Laravel, so I had to rename my events database to holidays, and the subsequent Eloquent model to Holiday.

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
* jQuery: http://jquery.com/
* jQuery UI Datepicker: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
* PHP Avenue helped me figure out how to calculate when certain holidays fall: http://phpave.com/how-to-calculate-mothers-day-and-fathers-day
